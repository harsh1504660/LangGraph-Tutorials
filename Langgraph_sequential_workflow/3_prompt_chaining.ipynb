Even though it started in the 60s, AI has created a ripple in the tech market of late through modern-day algorithmic innovations and machine learning approaches. It has played crucial roles from discovery to everyday life applications. AI in India is now a booming industry with a projected $9 billion$ market in 2021 and with an estimated 12% annual CAGR growth rate until 2023-25. This is creating enormous employment opportunities and intriguing growth possibilities for cybersecurity, healthcare, education, agriculture, banking, logistics & transportation, retail, etc. AI is claiming its next level in technology advancement, creating a techno wave globally, and India holds a potential stake.
